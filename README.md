# Coursera_Machine_Learning_Project
You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

k-Nearest Neighbour

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index

F1-score

LogLoass
