# Coursera_Machine_Learning_Project
You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

1. k-Nearest Neighbour

2. Decision Tree

3. Support Vector Machine

4. Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

1. Jaccard index

2. F1-score

3. LogLoass
